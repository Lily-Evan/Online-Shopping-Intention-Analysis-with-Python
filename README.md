🛍️ Online Shopping Intention Analysis with Python
A complete data science pipeline for understanding and predicting purchasing intentions in e-commerce through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering, and machine learning.

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages the Online Shoppers Intention Dataset to:

Analyze visitor behavior across an e-commerce platform

Segment users into meaningful clusters based on engagement patterns

Build predictive models to determine purchase intent

By combining statistical exploration, unsupervised learning, and interpretable machine learning, this analysis delivers valuable insights into what drives online purchases.

🧰 Technologies & Tools
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest

Model Explainability: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV

🧪 Analysis Workflow
1. 📥 Data Loading & Preprocessing
Reading the dataset and handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables and normalizing features

2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual exploration of key variables

Distribution plots, pairplots, correlation heatmaps, and behavior segmentation

3. 🔍 Clustering Analysis
