🛍️ Online Shopping Intention Analysis with Python
A comprehensive approach to understanding user purchase intentions in an e-commerce environment using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering, and machine learning (ML) models.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Online Shoppers Intention Dataset with the goal of:

Understanding the behavioral patterns of online visitors

Identifying distinct visitor groups through clustering

Training ML models to predict purchasing intent

🧰 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest

Model Interpretation: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV

🧪 Analysis Workflow
1. 📥 Data Loading & Preprocessing
Reading the dataset and handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables and normalizing features

2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical summaries and visualizations (distributions, correlations, feature relationships)

3. 🔍 Clustering Analysis
Applying the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Using K-Means clustering to group visitors by metrics like session duration and bounce rate

4. 🤖 Predictive Modeling
Training models: XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM

Evaluating with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

Comparing performance across algorithms

5. 🧠 Model Interpretability
Utilizing SHAP to explain model decisions

Identifying key features influencing purchase behavior
